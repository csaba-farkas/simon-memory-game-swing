content = History\n\nRalph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison [1] were first introduced to Atari\u2019s game Touch Me at the Music Operators of America (MOA) trade show in 1976.[2] Baer said of the product, \u201CNice gameplay. Terrible execution. Visually boring. Miserable, rasping sounds.\u201D[2] The original prototype, built by Baer, included the Texas Instruments TMS 1000 microprocessor chip, which was low cost and used by many games of the 1970s. Lenny Cope,[2] who was one of Ralph H. Baer\u2019s partners, worked on the programming code for the core of the game, titled Follow Me at the time. Baer developed the tones of the game, inspired by the notes of a bugle. It was when they pitched the demo, an 8-inch-by-8-inch console, to the Milton Bradley Company that the name of the game was changed to Simon. Simon debuted in 1978 at the cost of $24.95 (equivalent to $91 in 2015) and became one of the top selling toys that Christmas.[2]\nIn 2013, Hasbro re-invented Simon once again with Simon Swipe. The game was demonstrated at New York Toy Fair 2014 and was released in the Summer as planned.[3] The game is a circle that looks like a steering wheel. It has been extended from four buttons to eight touchscreen buttons which are flattened out on the unit.[4] The game feature four game modes which are called Levels, Classic, Party and Extreme. Levels is the main game of Simon Swipe. The player has to go through all sixteen levels to beat the game. Classic, Party and Extreme levels focus on one pattern getting longer and longer until the player is out. A smaller version of the game called Simon Micro Series was introduced in 2015. This version has only two game modes called Solo and Pass It and features 14 levels and four buttons.
